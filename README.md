# Welcome Waite, Waite Don't Till Me Cult...ivators!

Welcome to our cult...ivation group's very own custom hosted wiki website. This site will exist as a living repository of what we learn as a community garden group for hopefully years to come! I (Bryce) purchased the domain name for the next decade, so it is not going anywhere!

## What are we going to put in here?

The sky's the limit! I think I'm going to make some placeholder pages for some topic ideas. Some thoughts so far:

- [Soil testing](https://www.waitewaitedonttillme.com/example-page)
- [Water management](https://www.waitewaitedonttillme.com/example-page)
- [Symbiotic planting practices](https://www.waitewaitedonttillme.com/example-page)
- [Pest control without synthetic chemical intervention](https://www.waitewaitedonttillme.com/example-page)
- [Swap expectations](https://www.waitewaitedonttillme.com/example-page)
- [Main points of contact](https://www.waitewaitedonttillme.com/example-page)

## How do we crowdsource expertise and ideas for pages?

If you navigate to any page on this website, there is a comment section. That could be a good way to start, but ultimately we will want to organize the info into a wikipedia style article for that page. You can send me information on the WhatsApp group OR, if anyone would like, I can show you how to edit the pages directly and add your own information. I only ask, if you send me information to upload, that it be ready to be put into a wiki style article (or at least as much as possible); so on a succinct topic, non-rambling, etc. I can split things up a little bit into subheadings, but I don't want a dissertation on a topic that you transcribed with voice-to-text that has 10 topics and no subheadings. We can talk about it more and make a standard operating procedure for submitting information or editing the pages.
